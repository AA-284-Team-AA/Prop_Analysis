# Temporal performance analysis
## Usage

To use the code, use
```bash
python time_analysis.py <input_file_name>
```
By default, the code will look for `input.ini`. Instructions on what to provide to the input file are written as comments and should be self-explanatory.

To modify the `mdot_ox` profile, change the implementation of `get_desired_mdot_ox`.
